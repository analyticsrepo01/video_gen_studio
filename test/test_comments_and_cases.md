# Test Cases and Comments Documentation

## Image Editing Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic Image Editing
- **Purpose**: Test the basic `/api/edit-image` endpoint
- **Input**: Single image path + edit prompt
- **Expected**: 200 status code with description response
- **Comments**: This tests the core Gemini image analysis functionality

### Test Case 2: Image Editing with Validation
- **Purpose**: Test the `/api/edit-image-with-validation` endpoint
- **Input**: Image path + edit prompt + validation settings
- **Expected**: Success response with attempts array and final result
- **Comments**: Tests the retry logic and AI validation system

### Known Issues and Comments:
1. **from_image Error**: Fixed by replacing `types.Part.from_image()` with `types.Part.from_data()`
2. **Model Compatibility**: Using `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` for image analysis
3. **Timeout Settings**: 30s for basic editing, 60s for validation (allows retries)

## Style Mixing Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Analyze Mode
- **Purpose**: Test multi-image style analysis
- **Input**: 2-3 images + analyze prompt + "analyze" mode
- **Expected**: JSON response with individual_styles, style_combinations, recommendations
- **Comments**: Tests Gemini's ability to process multiple images simultaneously

### Test Case 2: Generate Mode
- **Purpose**: Test style combination guidance generation
- **Input**: 2 images + generation prompt + "generate" mode
- **Expected**: JSON response with style_synthesis, generation_prompt, technical_settings
- **Comments**: Tests AI's ability to provide actionable style mixing guidance

### Test Case 3: Guide Mode (Future)
- **Purpose**: Test step-by-step manual guidance
- **Input**: Multiple images + guide prompt + "guide" mode
- **Expected**: JSON response with step_by_step_guide, style_extraction, practical_tips
- **Comments**: Not tested yet - provides manual workflow guidance

### Known Issues and Comments:
1. **Multi-Image Processing**: Requires at least 2 images in output/images directory
2. **JSON Parsing**: Has fallback for non-JSON responses from Gemini
3. **File Validation**: Checks that all image files exist before processing
4. **5 Image Limit**: Maximum 5 images can be processed at once

## General Test Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites:
1. **Server Running**: Flask app must be running on localhost:5000
2. **Images Available**: At least 2 images in `app/output/images/` directory
3. **Environment**: Proper Google Cloud credentials configured
4. **Dependencies**: All Python packages installed (requests, etc.)

### Test Data Generation:
- Use Image Generation tab to create test images first
- Recommended: Generate images with different styles (realistic, artistic, cartoon)
- File formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG are supported

## Future Test Enhancements

### Additional Test Cases to Add:
1. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Invalid image paths
   - Missing files
   - Malformed requests
   - Network timeouts

2. **Edge Case Tests**:
   - Very large images (test file size limits)
   - Unsupported image formats
   - Empty prompts
   - Special characters in prompts

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Multiple concurrent requests
   - Processing time measurements
   - Memory usage monitoring

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - UI interaction simulation
   - File cleanup verification

### Test Automation:
- Consider adding pytest framework
- Add continuous integration hooks
- Create test image fixtures
- Implement result validation schemas

## Comments from Development:

### Image Editing Implementation Notes:
- Gemini doesn't actually edit images, it provides descriptions
- For real image editing, would need different approach (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Current implementation focuses on analysis and description generation
- Validation system helps improve prompt quality through iteration

### Style Mixing Implementation Notes:
- Uses Gemini's multi-modal capabilities effectively
- Three modes provide different types of creative assistance
- JSON structured responses make results easily parseable
- Fallback handling ensures robustness even with model inconsistencies

### Configuration and Setup Notes:
- All models configurable through config.json
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent API quota exhaustion
- File path validation prevents security issues
- Error logging helps with debugging
