A cinematic 8K, 8-second shot, mystical and contemplative. Very shallow depth of field (f/1.8), soft glowing bokeh. Color palette of deep indigo, warm gold, and earthy tones. in a simple, uncluttered bedroom with warm, earthy terracotta-colored walls and dark sheesham wood furniture. The scene is an extreme close-up on a simple black digital alarm clock (soft white numbers) and a glass of water on a dark sheesham wood nightstand. In the background, initially out of focus, is the sleeping a North Indian woman in her mid-30s. She has a serene, oval-shaped face, high cheekbones, large, expressive almond-shaped dark brown eyes, and a clear, fair skin tone. She has long, thick, dark wavy hair, parted in the middle. She is wearing no makeup. She is wearing the consistent simple, loose-fitting white cotton kurta (sleeping attire). on a pillow with bedsheets and pillowcases with a subtle, traditional Jaipuri block-print (paisley) pattern.. The clock's numbers show 3:39 AM. The camera executes a slow rack focus, pulling focus from the clock to the person's peaceful face. Just as their face comes into sharp focus, their eyes suddenly open wide.
